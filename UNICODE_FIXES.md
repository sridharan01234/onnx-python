# Unicode Encoding Fix Summary

## Problem
The GitHub Actions workflow was failing on Windows with the error:
```
Error exporting model: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\u2713' in position 0: character maps to <undefined>
```

This happens because Windows console uses 'charmap' encoding by default, which can't handle Unicode characters like checkmarks (‚úì).

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Windows Encoding Issue
Added UTF-8 encoding support to all Python scripts:

```python
# Fix Windows encoding issue
if sys.platform == "win32":
    import io
    sys.stdout = io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stdout.detach(), encoding='utf-8')
    sys.stderr = io.TextIOWrapper(sys.stderr.detach(), encoding='utf-8')
```

### 2. Replaced Unicode Characters
Replaced all Unicode symbols with ASCII equivalents:

- `‚úì` ‚Üí `[OK]`
- `‚ùå` ‚Üí `[FAIL]`
- `üî®` ‚Üí `[BUILD]`
- `üß™` ‚Üí `[TEST]`

### 3. Files Updated

1. **convert_to_onnx.py**
   - Added Windows encoding fix
   - Replaced `‚úì` with `[OK]`

2. **build.py**
   - Added Windows encoding fix
   - Replaced `‚úì` with `[OK]`
   - Replaced `‚ùå` with `[FAIL]`
   - Replaced `üî®` with `[BUILD]`

3. **server.py**
   - Added Windows encoding fix
   - Replaced `‚úì` with `[OK]`

4. **test_server.py**
   - Added Windows encoding fix
   - Replaced `‚úì` with `[OK]`
   - Replaced `üß™` with `[TEST]`

5. **setup.py**
   - Added Windows encoding fix
   - Replaced `‚úì` with `[OK]`

## Expected Result

The GitHub Actions workflow should now:
1. Successfully run `python convert_to_onnx.py` without encoding errors
2. Complete the ONNX model conversion
3. Successfully build executables for all platforms
4. Upload to S3 without issues

## Testing

The fixes maintain full functionality while ensuring cross-platform compatibility. All output messages are now using ASCII characters that work on all platforms.
